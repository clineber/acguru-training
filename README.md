Hello cloud gurus
putting in a change.

Welcome to the second edition of Pro Git. The first edition was published over
four years ago now. Since then a lot has changed and yet many important
things have not. While most of the core commands and concepts are still valid
today as the Git core team is pretty fantastic at keeping things backward compatible,
there have been some significant additions and changes in the community
surrounding Git. The second edition of this book is meant to address those
changes and update the book so it can be more helpful to the new user.
