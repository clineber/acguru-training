Hello cloud gurus
putting in a change.

Welcome to the second edition of Pro Git. The first edition was published over
four years ago now. Since then a lot has changed and yet many important
things have not. While most of the core commands and concepts are still valid
today as the Git core team is pretty fantastic at keeping things backward compatible,
there have been some significant additions and changes in the community
surrounding Git. The second edition of this book is meant to address those
changes and update the book so it can be more helpful to the new user.
When I wrote the first edition, Git was still a relatively diÂ€icult to use and
barely adopted tool for the harder core hacker. It was starting to gain steam in
certain communities, but had not reached anywhere near the ubiquity it has today.
Since then, nearly every open source community has adopted it. Git has
made incredible progress on Windows, in the explosion of graphical user interfaces
to it for all platforms, in IDE support and in business use. The Pro Git of
four years ago knows about none of that. One of the main aims of this new edition
is to touch on all of those new frontiers in the Git community.
